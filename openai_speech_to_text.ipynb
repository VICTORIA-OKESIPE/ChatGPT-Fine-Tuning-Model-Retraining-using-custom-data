She had a focus on the future for the pupils as well as teachers. The state government could not police the contractors all the time but she made do with what was done. But for her, the school would have gone the way of many Bolaike schools but she worked and persevered on the school. The parents, the pupils and the surrounding, I can hear her chuckle now laughing about a situation that frightened me. She would calmly ask about the next step and without saying anything would achieve the best anyone could under the circumstances. That was the only school for the Agbo community and those who live in that community knew how it was. She was very much loved. She never took anything for granted and was painstakingly about introducing us to skills at that early age. She not only taught us to bake but to see the money in baking and selling what was baked. She was also very thrifty and showed us the way to turn us into good sellers of what we produced. I am proud of the fact that I sold my baked products early in my marriage. I was afraid for her life when she lost her husband, the great mathematics teacher. For days I could not face her but I visited the house every day just to see her and I really feared for her life for she was a great homemaker but she rose above that and turned her attention on her children and the church and let her work and profession speak for her. She has always been a church woman having met Christ a long time ago but she never left her Catholic church. She invested heavily on the priests and new missions, on the minority of Mary in any form, on the ministry of Mary in any form. She gave to the training of priests to missionaries. She supported her church, SS Peter and Paul Bodijai Bado for all the years I knew her. She was an outstanding Yoruba woman, always well turned out. I am very proud of the Yoruba culture, royal dressing and she carried herself with dignity. She dressed properly and elegantly any time she went, anywhere she went. She was royalty at all times. I will miss her outstanding dress sense. I recall with great pride her work as a teacher, an outstanding teacher and as a Christian, a Roman Catholic member by excellence, a mother of millions whose lives depended on her till she passed on. What a lovely memory we have of her till date. May her work and work with Christ continue forever and may her tribe increase. Amen.\"\n",

She went to school as she had her children and she brought them up to be stars wherever they found themselves. She loved all in her world except perhaps the lazy. She followed her students and their families till Christ came for her. A most effective leader she was. She was unassuming but never took anything for granted.

For there is no way you can win souls without a mentor to direct you. This Baba Okereme did that for all around him, even when people like me took him for granted. I assume that he had more years to spend on this side of the divide. He was not a man of many words but was very effective reaching his goals, so focused was he that he did not believe in words but actions. For example, he made no noise about planting flowers and trees all around him. We also got that from him and he was a great praying man, always on his knees for all. He knew on whatever serious matter you brought to him, he would greatly say let us pray and then those heavy prayers would start. For example, no one came with a heavy heart and left the same way, enlightening our bodies.\"\n",

He would visit, encourage, bully the man he used to see but the home he remained at the end of the day is home. With Mama was so peaceful that the younger ones always wanted to visit. Even when they had no business there but sometimes someone who were ill would want to see Baba before getting to the hospital that was nearby. We thank God for that set up but this is a story for another day. He started building the church of tomorrow before anyone thought about it. And while younger people were complaining in the church ability, the doorman of their services, he built on the foundation of a young people's church which he found when he arrived at the church. He invested so much on the women and the young people of the church. What a joyful period that was at St. Anne's Church, Molete for Maine.\"\n",
